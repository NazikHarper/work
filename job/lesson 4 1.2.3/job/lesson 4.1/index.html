            When an ordinary teenager, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider, his life changed completely. Now he is fighting crime, hiding under the guise of Spider-Man.
        </p>
        <p>As a child, Peter Parker lost his parents, and Aunt May and Uncle Ben raised him as their own son. The boy studied well and achieved great success in the natural sciences, which is why his classmates did not take him seriously, considering him to be quiet and crammed. At one of the scientific exhibitions, Peter was bitten by a spider charged with a powerful dose of radiation. The bite influenced the genetic structure of Peter's body, endowing the guy with superpowers and unique abilities.</p>
        <p>Wanting to capitalize on his new powers, Peter made himself a unique costume and began to participate in ultimate fighting. Returning after another fight, Peter refused to stop the robber, believing that this case should be dealt with by the police. Later, the same criminal stumbled upon Uncle Ben and shot him when he tried to fight him back. Then Peter vowed to use his powers to fight crime, always keeping in mind the words of his uncle: "With great power comes great responsibility."</p>
        <p>Spider-Man has many dangerous enemies from which he has defended innocent New Yorkers many times. However, not everyone has a positive attitude towards the masked hero. The editor-in-chief of the Daily Bugle, Jay Jonah Jameson, in every issue tried to blacken the hero, accusing him of all sorts of crimes against society. Peter Parker decided to use this to his advantage, getting a job as a freelance photographer for the newspaper and supplying pictures of Spider-Man on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Человек-Паук обладает множеством уникальных способностей и является одним из самых сильных супергероев. Он может передвигаться по стенам и потолку, легко поднять предмет весом в десять тонн. Комбинация из акробатических трюков и искусственной паутины позволяет ему быстро двигаться, а сверхбыстрые рефлексы и «паучье» чутьё, помогают ему избегать ранений и предугадывать действия противника.</p>
        <p>Even before the spider bite, Peter Parker was one of the smartest people on the planet, his IQ is close to genius. He is well versed in chemistry, physics, biology and engineering. Thanks to his extensive knowledge of engineering, Peter was able to independently improve his costume with web shooters with heavy-duty artificial <a href="https://marvel.com.ru/heroes/chelovek-pauk">Spider-Man</a> </p>
